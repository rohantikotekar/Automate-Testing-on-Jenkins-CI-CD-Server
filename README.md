# Full Stack Python Application with CI/CD and Docker

## Description

This project is a full-stack Python application that demonstrates the use of Docker for containerization and CI/CD for automated deployment and testing. The application is deployed across three AWS EC2 servers (development, testing, and production) with automated Docker builds and test executions integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Features

- **Full-Stack Application**: A complete Python-based application with both front-end and back-end components.
- **Dockerized**: The application is containerized using Docker for consistent and scalable deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds and deployments to production with continuous integration and delivery.
- **Automated Testing**: Integration of automated test cases in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality.
- **Multiple Environments**: Deployment across development, testing, and production environments on AWS EC2 servers.

## Prerequisites

- **AWS EC2 Instances**: Three EC2 instances set up for development, testing, and production.
- **Docker**: Docker installed on all servers for containerization.
- **CI/CD Tool**: Jenkins or any CI/CD tool configured for build and deployment automation.
- **GitHub Tokens**: GitHub tokens for repository access and automated builds.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Configure Docker:

## Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project.
Define the necessary instructions to build your application.
Build the Docker image locally and push it to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
docker build -t your-image-name .
docker tag your-image-name your-registry/your-image-name
docker push your-registry/your-image-name
Set Up EC2 Servers:

## Launch three EC2 instances (dev, test, prod) and configure them with Docker.
Configure CI/CD:
 
## Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or another tool.
Configure it to build a new Docker image on each commit to the production branch.
Automate deployments to the EC2 instances.
Automate Testing:

## Integrate automated test cases into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before deployment.
Development: Push changes to the dev branch and deploy to the development server.
Testing: Push changes to the test branch and deploy to the testing server.
Production: Push changes to the prod branch to build and deploy to the production server.
Troubleshooting
Build Failures: Check Docker build logs and ensure that all dependencies are correctly specified.
Deployment Issues: Verify server configurations and ensure that Docker containers are running correctly.
Test Failures: Review CI/CD logs to identify and resolve any issues in automated tests.
